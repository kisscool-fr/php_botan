Here are some notes about various things I should/could/might do. If you're
interested in working on something here (or something else!), drop me an email
and we can coordinate efforts.

* Algorithms / Related
  - ECDSA
  - ECDH

* X.509 / PKCS / ASN.1
  - X.509 code is in need of a major cleanup, both API and internal
  - OCSP (RFC 2560)
  - Attribute Certificates (RFC 3281)
  - Support for Unicode (BMP STRING/UNIVERSAL STRING) strings in ASN1_String
  - Support for Unicode/UTF-8 strings everywhere they may show up (certs, etc)

* New Interfaces / Protocols
  - SSL/TLS: Alpha release is available (http://ajisai.randombit.net)
  - OpenPGP
  - CMS: incomplete sources in misc/cms
  - NIST's PKAPI: needs CMS

* Modules
  - EntropySources
      z/OS, OS/400, VMS
  - Compression: Zip, Gzip
  - Dynamic Algorithm Loader
     - Maybe, (maybe, maybe) integrate it with the stuff in algolist.cpp
       so it can do automatic lookup. I'm rather skeptical of this approach
       but it is a possibility.
   - mp_asm64: z/Series
   - HTTP certificate store access
   - Engines
      - VIA PadLock
      - Broadcom BCM582x: Free Linux drivers are available, but I need a card
                          to test against.
      - CryptoSwift: Rainbow blew me off when I contacted them. I have a card,
                     I just need drivers and API docs.
      - Hifn: Sokretis sells them cheap, but drivers may be an issue.
      - IBM 4758 / CCA
      - HP / Atalla
      - Intel Performance Primitives library
      - PKCS #11
      - Other suggestions welcome

* Configure / Build System
  - The build system doesn't handle GCC on Windows well
  - Support for new OSes:
     - z/OS
     - OS/400
     - VMS
     - Hurd
     - Plan 9
  - Support more packaging systems
     - Debian
     - Solaris
     - MacOS X [Fink?]
     - Windows binary installer
